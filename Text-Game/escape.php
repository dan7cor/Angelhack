      <p>Your team runs as fast as they can, there is not much of a fight since you have cleared the way in the first floor.</p>
      <p>As you arrive at the door from where you entered, you hear the footsteps of the remaining soldiers chasing you. You kill the lights and
        run towards the darkness</p>
      <p>You run and run until you arrive at the extract point, where there is a helicopter waiting for you.</p>
      <p><b>CONGRATULATIONS, you have finished the mission</b></p>
      <p>Thanks for your time.</p>
