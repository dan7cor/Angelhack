      <p>You head towards the nearest tower, once you arrive and enter the tower, you send Hush to kill the guard on top of the tower and you proceed 
        to open the electric box with all the cable connexions. luckily both you and Leonardo know electric circuits and carry remote controlled electronic
        gadgets.</p>
      <p>You leave the tower with the guards dead and with the lights hacked, at the click of the remote control, these lights will shut down.</p>
      <p>You need to hurry now, every minute counts, the guards will get suspicious when the  radio contact with the guard tower is lost for too long</p>
