    <p>You have arrived at the drop zone, after hiding the parachutes you make your way up the mountains toward the enemy base.</p>
    <p class="stealth"> You remain hidden in the forest as you make your way up towards the enemy base, you see some soldiers patrolling the mountain road, but they don't see you</P>
    <p class="bellicose"> You run towards the base, on the way you see 2 soldiers patrolling the mountain way, nothing a couple of shots can't fix, lets hope the rest of the base did not hear that.</p>
    <p class="witty"> You move towards the base, you spot 2 soldiers on the mountain road. You wait for them to return to base and continue moving towards the enemy base</p>

    <p>You arrive at a vantage point from where you can see both points of access which are guarded, also, you have a clear line to the wall, maybe you could try to climb it.</p>
